# 01. ABOUT ME

Hey! My name is Goro and I enjoy building things and leaving my mark on the internet. Similar to many in my generation, I had a brief flirtation with web development during the web 2.0 blogging era. My interest in software engineering was reignited after seeing the artwork of Forensic Archictecture and the many projects that sprang up for social good during the pandemic. It turns out that the web doesn't have to be about just advertisement.

I've recently graduated from a the Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly, a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.   

Here are a few technologies I've been working with Recently
- Javascript (ES6+)
- React
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- GraphQL
